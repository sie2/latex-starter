README file for LaTeX Math for Undergraduates

This is a cheat sheet for writing mathematics with LaTeX focused on the
needs of US undergraduates.

When I asked my students for feedback on LaTeX the consensus was that
it was pretty straightforward but that they needed a list of symbols.  
This is my response.

FEEDBACK

I would appreciate any corrections.  Note though that a document like
this requires that things are boiled down so I have deliberately kept
out packages other than the AMS ones, and in some places I have made
choices such as using an italic d in the integral.  The beauty of
providing the source is that if your choices differ then you can just
make your own tweaks.
